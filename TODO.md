* Encapsulate connected components separation in NodeCut class (argument x_values not needed)
* Unit test: solution is an entire connected component in the input graph
* isValid in NodeCutUnrooted
* More sophisticated branching rules (favor y-vars)
* Use rooted formulation in unrooted call backs (addLocal)
* Handle components inside callbacks (get rid of enumeration
  functionality)
